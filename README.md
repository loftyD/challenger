# Challenger
Simple Spigot/Paper Plugin for Minecraft.

* Requires EssentialsX and Multiverse.


This plugin allows you to request to challenge another player to a 1v1 duel in a map named 'pvp'. Should the other player accept the fight, then they'll also be teleported to you.

This plugin is used on the QuartzSMP Minecraft Server (mc.quartzsmp.com).
